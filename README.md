This is my first App in C# which will present an Easter destination within Greece.

You are invited to develop a windowed windows forms app in Visual Studio, with C#, which will present an Easter destination within Greece, of your choice. This assignment acts as an extension of the previous, bonus assignment you had received.
Your app will include different forms: An initial one, where the user will have to enter a code to enter the main form-menu, and the others where you are expected to present information in text format, as well as images, and audio files.
Indicative categories you can include:
✓ Brief overview of the site
✓ Sightseeing
✓ A brief history of the site
✓ History of the area ✓ History of the area ✓ History of the area ✓ History of the area ✓ History of the area
✓ Visual material (photos)
✓ Audio material
Additional information:
➢ Within your application there should be at least one menu of options
➢ All the information of your app, texts, audiovisual material should not be located in the resources of the app, but loaded from corresponding files that will accompany your app.
➢ You should make use of dialogue windows. Each user will be able to change the color of the form they are in. In addition, in areas where you have information as text, there will be a button that will allow the user to "save" the text information as a text file, using a corresponding dialog box, with a file name of their choice.
